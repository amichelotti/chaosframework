## Description ##
The !CHAOS project aims to develop a new concept of control system and data acquisition framework by providing, with a high level of abstraction, all the services needed for controlling and managing a large scientific, or non-scientific, infrastructure.
!CHAOS redefines the Control System paradigm by introducing the new concept of Control Service, i.e. a distributed, scalable provider offering, to a general class of clients, high- performance services such as data sharing, commands dispatching, continuous historical data archiving, configuration tools, middle-layer resource management, etc ...

The key features and development strategies of !CHAOS are: scalability of performances and size:
* integration of all functionalities
* abstraction of services, devices and data
* easy and modular customisation
* extensive data catching for performance boost high-performance internet software technologies.
